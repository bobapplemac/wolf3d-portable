# Development log

Graphical captures are generated from the user's external Wolfenstein 3D data
and remain under the Git-ignored `out/` directory. They are never distributed
with the source repository. Each entry records a deterministic indexed-frame
hash so the milestone remains verifiable even when the screenshot is absent.

## 2026-09-23: Initial E1M1 walls and doors

- Commit: `a3f6c09`
- Scope: fixed-point ray traversal, original wall textures, closed door plane,
  ceiling/floor colors; no actors, first-person weapon, or status bar.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a: `52a9cf2dd9dcab66`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.

## 2026-09-23: Original static status bar

- Scope: `STATUSBARPIC`, initial BJ face, floor, score, lives, health, ammo,
  empty key slots, and pistol icon, ported into `WL_AGENT.c`.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a: `b2f43cae26b556f5`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.

Regenerate the latest capture with:

```

The PPM is the authoritative output. The PNG shown above is a convenience copy
created locally for visual inspection.

## 2026-09-23: First-person ready pistol

- Scope: the original compiled pistol sprite rendered with a portable
  `SimpleScaleShape` translation at the original 161-unit weapon scale.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a, including the HUD: `ab0c1a3f48fece62`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.

## 2026-09-23: Static objects and wall occlusion

- Scope: original plane-1 static-object scan, `TransformTile` projection,
  ray-traversal `spotvis`, far-to-near ordering, and per-column `ScaleShape`
  wall occlusion.
- The normal initial frame remains `ab0c1a3f48fece62`: its closed door correctly
  hides the corridor scenery.
- The diagnostic below uses the same E1M1 starting pose with all doors in their
  original fully-open state so ceiling lights and floor objects are visible.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a, including weapon and HUD: `800512fcf839700f`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.
- Corrected during the guard milestone to use `ScaleShape`'s `height >> 3`
  world scale; the earlier capture incorrectly reused `SimpleScaleShape`'s
  first-person weapon scale.

## 2026-09-23: Initial standing and patrolling guards

- Scope: original easy/medium/hard guard map-code layering, `SpawnStand`,
  initial `SpawnPatrol` placement, `TransformActor`, neighboring-tile visibility,
  and eight-way `CalcRotate` sprite selection.
- E1M1 medium difficulty creates 17 guards; baby creates 10 and hard creates 32.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a, including weapon and HUD: `a6db229142f7150b`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.
- The diagnostic pose is three tiles west of E1M1's final map-order guard and
  does not alter ordinary level initialization.

## 2026-09-23: Ordinary enemy setup and dead guards

- Scope: original map-code setup for guards, officers, SS, dogs, mutants, and
  inert dead guards, including each difficulty band and initial stand/patrol
  state shape.
- E1M1 medium difficulty creates 17 live guards, three dogs, and one inert dead
  guard; baby creates 12 total actors and hard creates 38.
- 320x200 indexed-frame FNV-1a, including weapon and HUD: `0b077346cfd7b513`
- Identical result with the supplied WL1 and WL6 data sets.
- The corpse and locked door in this normal starting pose are both original
  E1M1 map objects; no diagnostic level-state changes are applied.
