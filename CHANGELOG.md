# Changelog

## Unreleased - Repository split

- Created `wolf3d-portable` from a path-filtered copy of the original
  `wolf3dgeneric` history so host work retains authorship and context.
- Moved Win32, SDL3, and direct-console ownership into this repository.
- Added `wolf3d-lib` as a reproducibly pinned, `main`-tracking submodule.
- Made every wrapper compile the submodule library and consume only its public
  `WOLF3D.h` and `wolf3d::wolf3d` interface.
- Added `make fresh` for the explicitly latest-library development workflow
  and embedded the exact library version and commit in every distribution.

Earlier implementation history remains available in Git. Engine behavior and
library revisions are documented by `lib/wolf3d/CHANGELOG.md`.
