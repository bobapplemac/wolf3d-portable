# Building wolf3d-portable

## Dependencies

Initialize both submodules before configuring:

```text
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The `lib/wolf3d` gitlink records the exact engine revision. `third_party/SDL3`
records the default GUI dependency. A system SDL 3.2 or newer is also
supported.

## Windows

Visual Studio and CLI builds share the CMake trees under `build/`:

```text
cmake --preset windows-dev-x64
cmake --build --preset windows-dev-x64
```

The development preset builds both GUI hosts. Dedicated distribution presets
are `windows-release-{x64,x86}` for Win32 and `windows-sdl3-{x64,x86}` for
SDL3. The MSVC runtime is statically linked by default; set
`WG_STATIC_MSVC_RUNTIME=OFF` in a separate build tree to use the matching
Visual C++ Redistributable.

The checked-in `wolf3d-portable.sln` invokes these same configurations from
Visual Studio.

## Linux

`make` defaults to the pinned-SDL3 distribution. Useful targets include:

```text
make help
make dependencies
make fresh
make sdl3-release
make console-release
make releases
make portable-sdl3
make portable-console
make portable
make musl-sdl3
make clean
```

GCC is the default. Select Clang with `CC=clang`. Set
`USE_SYSTEM_SDL3=ON` to use the installed SDL package. `CMAKE_ARGS` passes
additional definitions through to configuration, and `JOBS=N` limits build
parallelism.

The console host requires libdrm and ALSA development packages. SDL3 builds do
not require those packages directly. The pinned build dynamically discovers
available X11, Wayland, KMS/DRM, and audio backends.

## Reproducibility and latest-main builds

Ordinary builds are offline with respect to `wolf3d-lib`: they use the
committed gitlink. `make fresh` runs:

```text
git submodule update --remote --merge -- lib/wolf3d
git submodule update --init --recursive
make all
```

This is intentionally convenient for active integration. Commit the resulting
gitlink to make that engine selection reproducible. Every staged folder
contains `WOLF3D-LIB.txt` with the resolved `1.4.REVISION` and full commit SHA.

## Linux portability

The portable targets build inside the digest-pinned Debian 10 container and
audit staged ELFs against glibc 2.28. The SDL package includes its pinned SDL3
shared object and uses `$ORIGIN`; normal kernel, graphics, input, and audio
facilities remain system supplied. `make clean` removes project build trees
and the project-named Docker image without pruning unrelated Docker data.

For a distribution-independent userspace bundle, run:

```text
make musl-sdl3
```

`make universal-sdl3` is an equivalent descriptive alias. This target builds
the executable, wolf3d-lib, Nuked-OPL3, and the pinned SDL3 inside a
digest-pinned Alpine 3.20 container. It stages an AppDir-style directory named
`wolf3d-portable-1.4.REVISION-sdl3-linux-musl-x64` containing a top-level
`wolf3d` launcher, the application under `bin/`, and a closed set of shared
objects plus the musl loader under `lib/`.

GCC is the default musl compiler. `make musl-sdl3 CC=clang` selects the Clang
toolchain in the same container and keeps its build tree separate.

The audit rejects GLIBC symbol versions, rejects unresolved direct ELF
dependencies, and executes `wolf3d --sdl3-help` through the bundled loader.
The resulting directory can be copied intact to another x86-64 Linux system;
SDL discovers the destination's X11 or Wayland display and ALSA, PulseAudio,
or PipeWire service dynamically. OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan, SDL GPU, and KMSDRM
are deliberately disabled in this package: wolf3d-portable already renders
its framebuffer in software, and excluding those paths avoids graphics-stack
ABI dependencies. The separate direct-console host remains available for a
DRM/KMS-only system.
